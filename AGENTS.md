# Agent Guidelines — Docker Outside of Docker

You are running inside a VS Code devcontainer. Read this file before doing any Docker-related work.

> If a `LOCAL.md` file exists in this directory, read it — it contains environment-specific setup details for this machine. If it doesn't exist, ignore this note.

## Your environment

- You are inside a devcontainer, not on the host machine directly.
- You have access to the host's Docker daemon via Docker-outside-of-Docker (DooD). You can run `docker` and `docker compose` commands normally.
- You **cannot** browse the host filesystem. Paths like `/opt/...` that you reference in Docker configs exist on the host, not inside this container. Do not try to read or write them — just reference them correctly in your Docker configuration.

## Host filesystem conventions

`/opt` paths exist on the **host only**. The agent runs inside a devcontainer and cannot read, list, or inspect anything under `/opt` — do not attempt to `ls`, `cat`, or browse those paths.

Everything for Pacearr lives under a single directory on the host:

```
/opt/pacearr/
```

All files the app needs — config, database, logs, whatever — go directly in there. Do not create subdirectories like `config/`, `data/`, or `logs/` unless the app itself requires a specific path inside the container. Keep it flat.

## Docker naming conventions

When building images or creating containers for this app, use the app name directly — do not suffix with `-app`, `-container`, `-service`, or similar.

| Thing | Correct | Incorrect |
|---|---|---|
| Image name | `pacearr` | `pacearr-app`, `pacearr-image` |
| Container name | `pacearr` | `pacearr-app`, `pacearr-container` |
| Compose service name | `pacearr` | `app`, `pacearr-service` |

If the app has multiple distinct services in the future, use `pacearr-frontend`, `pacearr-api` etc.

## Bind mounts

Bind-mount the entire app directory from the host into the container as a single volume. Do not use named Docker volumes — the user needs to be able to inspect and edit files directly on the host.

Example docker-compose service:

```yaml
services:
  pacearr:
    image: pacearr
    container_name: pacearr
    network_mode: bridge
    ports:
      - "9302:9302"
    volumes:
      - /opt/pacearr:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Map `/opt/pacearr` on the host to whatever path the app expects internally. Pacearr currently expects `/config`.

## Where your app code is

Your workspace is mounted at `/workspaces/pacearr` inside this container. This is the same directory as `app/` on the host at `/opt/vscode/node/pacearr/app/`.

## Networking

Always use bridge networking — it is the only mode that works reliably with DooD on this host.

- `docker run`: include `--network bridge`
- Compose services: set `network_mode: bridge`
- `docker build`: do **not** pass `--network`

Do not use `host`, `none`, or custom named networks unless explicitly requested.

## Summary checklist before creating any container

- [ ] Image name matches the app name
- [ ] Container name matches the app name
- [ ] `/opt/pacearr` on the host bind-mounted as a single volume
- [ ] Host directory documented or created in setup steps
- [ ] `--network bridge` / `network_mode: bridge` set

## GitHub Workflow And Release Process

### Before Starting Any Work — Branch Check

If this workspace is a git repository, always check the current branch with:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

Then act on what you find:

| Current branch | Situation | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `develop` | On the integration branch | Create a new `type/description` branch from `develop` and switch to it |
| `main` | On the stable branch | Create a new `type/description` branch from `develop`, not from `main` |
| `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*` etc. | Already on a work branch | Continue work here — no new branch needed |
| Something unexpected | Unfamiliar branch | Ask the user before proceeding |

Do this before making edits in a git-backed Pacearr repo. Never start work and then create the branch after the fact. If the workspace is not a git repository, state that clearly and continue with the requested local work.

---

### The Full Development Flow

This is the required workflow for GitHub-backed changes:

```
type/branch-name branch → PR into develop → develop → chore/bump-version → PR into develop → PR into main → tag → release
```

1. Start a new branch from `develop` for every piece of work — features, bug fixes, chores, CI changes, everything. Never commit new work directly to `develop` or `main`.
   - Branch naming: `feat/short-description`, `fix/short-description`, `chore/short-description`, `ci/short-description`, `docs/short-description`
2. Do the work on that branch. Commit as many times as needed.

2a. Get a cross-AI review before opening the PR. See "Cross-AI Review Before Opening The PR" below — this is mandatory, not optional polish. Push the branch to GitHub whenever the reviewer needs to see it (the diff can also be pasted directly into the prompt) — pushing early is fine. What matters is that the **PR itself** is not opened until a full review comes back clean.
3. Open a PR from that branch into `develop` using `gh pr create`. This feeds release notes, so the PR title becomes the changelog entry. Use a semantic title (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.).
4. Merge the PR into `develop`. Delete the branch after merging.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each piece of work. `develop` accumulates all merged PRs.
6. When ready to release, create a `chore/bump-version-X.Y.Z` branch from `develop`.
7. Bump `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, open a PR from that branch into `develop`, and merge it.
8. Open a PR from `develop` into `main`. Merge it. This triggers release notes from all PR titles since the last release.
9. Tag `main` with `vX.Y.Z` and push the tag. This triggers Docker build workflows when configured.
10. Publish the GitHub release — review the auto-generated draft and publish it.

### Cross-AI Review Before Opening The PR (Mandatory)

Pacearr is worked on by two AI agents — Claude and Codex — usually in separate chat sessions, with the user relaying messages between them. Before step 3 above (opening the PR), every branch — feature, fix, chore, CI, or docs, matching "the required workflow for all changes" at the top of this flow — must go through a review pass by the *other* agent. This is required, not optional polish: it catches real issues before human review, which substantially cuts down the back-and-forth.

**Roles are relative, not fixed to a specific AI.** Whichever agent wrote the code is "the implementer"; the other agent is "the reviewer." If Codex implemented, Claude reviews, and vice versa — this section applies symmetrically regardless of which agent is reading it right now.

**When this starts:** once the implementer believes the work is complete *and* the user has confirmed they're happy with it. Not before — the user is still the gate on scope and direction.

**The review loop** (the implementer drives this state machine — never wait for the user to ask "what's next" or "can you do a full review"):

| Last review was... | Result | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| Full | Clean | Branch is cleared to open the PR (step 3) |
| Full | Findings | Resolve each finding (see below), then request a **delta review** scoped to just the fix/disposition |
| Delta | Clean | Automatically request a new **full review** from scratch — a clean delta is never the finish line |
| Delta | Findings | Resolve each finding (see below), then request another **delta review** |

In words: the first review of a branch is always a full review of the whole diff. From there, keep alternating — a delta review after every round of fixes, and once a delta review comes back clean, immediately trigger one more full review from scratch, offered without being asked, before considering the branch done. Only a **full** review pass coming back clean clears the branch to open a PR; a clean delta review alone is never sufficient on its own. Keep alternating full ⇄ delta-until-clean until a full pass finds nothing new. This catches things a narrow delta view misses (e.g. the same unsafe pattern repeated elsewhere in the codebase) while keeping most rounds cheap.

**Resolving a finding:** "findings" doesn't mean every suggestion must be applied as-is. If the implementer agrees, fix it. If the implementer disagrees, it should respond to the reviewer with its reasoning and evidence instead of silently applying (or silently ignoring) the suggestion. The reviewer re-evaluates against that reasoning. If they still disagree after that exchange, surface it to the user for a decision — neither agent unilaterally overrides the other. Whatever the outcome — a code change or a deliberate no-change — send it through the next delta review like any other resolved finding, so the reviewer confirms the final state before the next full pass.

**Minimal effort for the user:** their job is only to paste the prompt into the other agent's chat and paste the response back here. The implementer tracks review state (was the last request a delta or a full pass? did it come back clean?) and always produces the next prompt proactively.

### How The Agent Should Interpret The User's Instructions

The user will not always use precise git terminology. They may say things like:

- "that's ready, push it" — push the current branch to GitHub if not already pushed, then open a PR from it into `develop`
- "commit that to develop" — open a PR into `develop`, not a direct commit
- "let's get this into develop" — same as above, open a PR
- "merge develop into main" or "push to main" — this is a release step; see the release flow above

When the user's instruction is ambiguous, either:

- Interpret it charitably as the correct workflow step and proceed, explaining what you're doing
- Push back briefly if genuinely unclear

Never silently commit directly to `develop` or `main` when the user is describing feature or fix work. That bypasses PRs and breaks release notes.

---

### GitHub CLI Usage

For GitHub-related work, use `gh` as the default tool. Use it for:

- opening PRs (`gh pr create`)
- checking PR status, checks, and mergeability
- merging PRs (`gh pr merge`)
- inspecting workflow runs and CodeQL alerts
- creating and publishing releases

Prefer `gh` over inferring GitHub state from local git — it gives the authoritative picture of what is open, merged, or failing on GitHub.

### AI Sign-Off For GitHub Text

Any text the agent sends to GitHub or stores in git history as authored output must end with an explicit AI sign-off.

This applies to **body text and comments only** — never to titles or subjects:

- commit messages
- pull request descriptions (body)
- issue comments
- pull request comments
- pull request reviews
- any other agent-authored text posted to GitHub

Do **not** append the sign-off to PR titles, issue titles, or any other subject/headline field.

Use the sign-off that matches the agent:

- `🤖 Generated with Codex`
- `🤖 Generated with Claude Code`

If the user explicitly asks for a different agent label, follow that request. Otherwise, always append the correct sign-off at the end of the text.

---

### Pull Request Description Format

Every PR description must follow this structure. Sparse descriptions are not acceptable — include enough information that a reviewer can understand what changed and how to verify it without reading the diff first.

```markdown
## Summary

A short paragraph or bullet list explaining what this PR does and why. Mention the user-facing or system-level effect, not just implementation detail.

## Changes

A file-by-file or component-by-component breakdown of what was modified and what each change does. Group related changes together.

## Test plan

A markdown checklist of concrete steps to verify the change works correctly.

🤖 Generated with [Agent Name]
```

Minimum bar: every PR must have all three sections. A test plan with one item is fine if the change is small; a changes section with a single file is fine too. Do not omit sections or write placeholders like "verify it works".

If the PR was prompted by an open GitHub issue, include a `Closes #<number>` line in the description body, not the title.

---

### Branch Rules Summary

| Branch | Purpose | How things get in |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*` etc. | Active work | Direct commits |
| `develop` | Integration | PRs from `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `ci/*`, `docs/*` etc. |
| `main` | Stable/released | PRs from `develop` only |

- Do not push new feature or fix work directly to `develop` or `main`
- Do not open PRs directly from feature branches into `main`

---

### Pull Request Conventions

- Use semantic PR titles: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `ci:`
- Follow the PR description format defined above
- Call out explicitly if the change affects: release behavior, Docker publishing, auth, database schema, Plex/Sonarr/Tautulli integrations, cleanup/deletion behavior, or user-visible setup

---

### Release Process

When the user says it's time to release:

1. Confirm the version bump size — ask for patch / minor / major if not stated
2. Create a `chore/bump-version-X.Y.Z` branch from `develop`
3. Update `package.json` and `package-lock.json` with the new version
4. Open a PR from that branch into `develop` and merge it
5. Open a PR from `develop` into `main` and merge it
6. Push the tag `vX.Y.Z` from `main`
7. Review the release-drafter draft on GitHub and publish it

Version files to update:

- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`

`src/server/version.ts` reads dynamically from `package.json` at runtime — no separate update needed there.

Do not invent the version. Always confirm with the user if ambiguous.

Tag format: `vX.Y.Z` — always from `main`, never from `develop`.

---

### Agent Behaviour — Snyk

When working through Snyk findings:

1. Always explain the finding first — describe what Snyk flagged, why it flagged it, and whether it is a genuine issue or a false positive before suggesting any action.
2. Recommend Fix or Won't Fix honestly — if fixing the issue would require writing worse code, less readable code, or code purely to satisfy static analysis, say so clearly and recommend Won't Fix instead.
3. When recommending Won't Fix, always provide:
   - A plain-English comment the user can paste into the Snyk GUI
   - The correct Snyk category to select: **Won't Fix** for false positives or deliberate decisions, **Ignore Temporarily** only if there is a genuine plan to revisit
4. Never suggest a change purely to appease Snyk if it doesn't improve actual security or code quality.

If `SECURITY.md` exists, read it for the full Snyk tooling guide, scan commands, and philosophy.

### Implementation Expectations — Logging And Comments

When implementing new functionality, treat logging and code clarity as part of the feature work, not optional polish.

#### Logging

- Consider logging for every new feature, workflow, integration, or background process where runtime visibility would help with debugging, support, or diagnosing failures
- Think through logging across the full implementation path, not just one layer — request handling, service logic, scheduled work, external API calls, and error paths where relevant
- Add logs that are useful and intentional: enough context to understand what happened, without spamming noisy or redundant messages
- Prioritise logs around important state changes, failures, retries, skipped work, destructive cleanup, and external-system interactions when those would otherwise be hard to trace
- Use the appropriate log level: `info` for normal significant events, `warn` for recoverable failures or skipped work, `error` for failures that need attention, and `debug` for diagnostic detail
- Pass structured data as the second `meta` argument rather than interpolating values into the message string, for example `logger.info("Sync complete", { count: 5 })`
- If rewriting an existing section of code that has no logging, add appropriate logging at that point — the absence of logs is often what made the original issue hard to diagnose

#### Code comments

- Add explanatory comments where they materially improve readability or maintainability, especially around non-obvious logic, edge cases, or decisions that are easy to misread later
- Keep comments clear and purposeful; do not add comments that only restate what the code already says
- When a future maintainer might reasonably ask "why is this written this way?", prefer a short comment that answers that question at the point of implementation

#### Technical docs

- Treat technical documentation as part of the implementation for major or long-lived changes, not optional follow-up work
- If a change affects architecture, sync/import flow, persistence, external integrations, cleanup/deletion behavior, or runtime behavior in a lasting way, update the relevant file under `docs/` in the same branch/PR
- If `docs/README.md` exists, start there when deciding where documentation belongs
- If no existing technical doc fits the change cleanly, add a new topic doc under `docs/` and link it from `docs/README.md`

---

### End-to-End Tests — Playwright

If Pacearr has Playwright test infrastructure, use these expectations:

- Tests live in `tests/playwright/` and run with `npm run test:e2e`
- Tests should hit a live running Pacearr instance — no mocking, no test database — unless the test harness explicitly says otherwise
- Auth should use a `SESSION_COOKIE` env var in `.env.playwright` (gitignored), not a browser-driven OAuth flow, because the devcontainer has no display
- Session state should be saved to `tests/playwright/.auth/storageState.json` (gitignored) after the first successful auth
- New test files go in `tests/playwright/` as `*.spec.ts` when that runner exists
- `playwright.config.ts` and `tsconfig.playwright.json` control the runner when present

When implementing a new feature, before closing out the work consider whether a Playwright test makes sense for it. If it does, suggest it to the user — describe what you'd test and ask if they want it added. Don't add tests silently. When a test is agreed and written, add a row for it in the relevant table in `TESTING.md` if that file exists.

---

### Agent Behaviour Expectations

Actively guide the workflow rather than waiting for perfect instructions:

- When the user starts new work in a git-backed repo: create a branch from `develop` automatically
- When the user says the work is ready: open a PR to `develop`, don't push directly
- When the user asks about releasing: confirm whether they mean prep, tag, or both
- When the user asks for a version bump: confirm patch/minor/major if not stated
- When the user's language conflicts with the workflow: interpret charitably or push back clearly — never silently do the wrong thing
